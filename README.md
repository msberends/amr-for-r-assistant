# AMR for R Assistant (Helper Repo)

<https://chat.amr-for-r.org>

This repo provides these things:
* `index.html` is a redirect to our actual ChatGPT link, so that <https://chat.amr-for-r.org> works (via GitHub Pages in this repo)
* `CNAME` was automatically created by GitHub Pages to allow the redirect
* `latest_training_data.txt` contains the latest info from the package, is uploaded automatically, and fetched and read by the GPT before initial reponse, to set its training data
